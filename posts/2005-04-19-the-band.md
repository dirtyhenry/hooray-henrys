  title: The band
  content: "Hi kids, I'm guiguilele, the official-unofficial manager of this two-pieces-of-rock'n'roll-master
    band. Maybe you want to know the real story about how the band was created. Let
    me explain this feary tail, as I like to call it.\r\nOnce upon a time, when I
    still was a young blond boy, I create the hooray henrys (Dirty was the dirty one,
    Groovy was the groovy one). Yeah, the hooray henrys was a concept of mine. \r\nI
    have barelly forgotten these childhood companions. But at the 24th June of 2001,
    a too-long-to-explain event makes me remember this fabulous imaginary friends.
    During more than a year, I cast musicians and singers all around the world, in
    order to find the best elements I could not even expect in my most beautiful dreams.\r\n365
    days later, I was totally disappointed because I still do not find what I was
    looking for. As I was so tired, I finally took two poor guys in a backstreet of
    Bordeaux. I bought them pants and rock'n'roll shoes.\r\nAnd that was how the Hooray
    Henrys story began.\r\nNow, they have grown, they are better than ever and I'm
    really proud to be their manager !"
