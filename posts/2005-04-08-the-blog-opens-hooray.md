    you post, not not now, but it seems it doesn't work... \r\nI am a little bit disapointed,
    if you get it. \r\nI am your very first fan and, above all, your very first singer
    and I hope we will be able to soon listen to your own music !"

{*Hooray Henrys*} are a new band.

Here is the blog where you will be able to keep an eye over the band's life. Let's celebrate the opening of the blog with the 1st Hooray Henrys' release on the Dead Rooster Records label we have created to record our songs.

The song is a cover of Hot Hot Heat's *No, Not Now*.
