We did our last rehearsal for the 2004-2005 season last thursday. This summer,
Groovy will leave Paris to more lucratic locations so we've decided that by now,
Hooray Henrys lie fallow until september.

When we get there, our objective will be quite ambitious : the recording of a 11
Hooray Henrys made songs record ! Six of them have been quickly played thursday
and we are quite enthousiastic about them so be patient and you won't get
disappointed.
