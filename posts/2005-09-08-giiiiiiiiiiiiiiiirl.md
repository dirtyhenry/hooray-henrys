  content: "...We were rehearsing for the upcoming tour at that time. Before joining
    the others in the studio, Ron and I usually had a walk downtown and we often dropped
    into small clubs to hear “what the new sound gives” as French people say... I
    love French people, but they often come into cheesy crap. You can’t treat them
    serious actually. I mean…Have you read Rousseau ? That’s a shame, you’ve missed
    one of the funniest time you can imagine. This man is a joke….\r\nAnyway, Ron
    and I had just ordered our supposed last whiskeys when we saw a small rusty wizard
    jump onto his drums and a strong squared-shoulder boy grab his guitar and both
    start rocking hard. That was oh damn riffin’, I can tell you ! Like the Devil
    himself was stroking their hands and fingers... We dropped our glasses and kept
    our mouths shut for the rest of the gig. Just listening…We were attending the
    Devil’s funerals. Every single naughty angel had decided to celebrate Chaos’birthday
    his own way, and I was invited ! Was the world collapsing ? No, I was…They just
    blew us… I don’t really remember what they sounded like, but I know it was all
    about making people jump around and watch angels dance on top of the drums…\r\nI
    hope we could still rock like that… I hope we already have !… Maybe thirty years
    ago, or maybe never… By the way, have you listened to “ A Bigger Bang” ? … Sucks,
    doesn’t it ? I know, it’s all Mick. Except “Rough Justice” and “Back of my Hand
    “… These are “Exile” leftovers, it’s Mick Taylor on both. But don’t say it loud,
    Ron has been trying to kick alcohol away really hard…\r\n\r\nK. R."
