girl, i don't want you to be a part-time
_ i don't want you to be the sunshine
_ be a full person by your own

girl, i think you've underrated your part
_ get off the shadow, let's get outside
_ i don't expect backstage for you

girl, i will never sell off my talks
_ i leave mediocrity off my walk
_ no pleasing meaningless love words

please look at me in the eyes
_ if you want to be my girl
_ cause if you don't
_ don't you know that i will make you cry
_ i'm looking forward, the future is ours
_ be confident, we won't lose control
_ there won't be any need to hide
_ there won't be any need to swallow our pain!

girl, I don't want me to be set unfree
_ we both don't have to turn a monster
_ watch out our minds, watch out our bodies

_ god only knows what I'll be
_ god only knows what I'll be
_ god only knows what I'll be
_ without you!
